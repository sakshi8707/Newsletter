          <p class="text-justify font-weight-normal">It's the mid of 2022, when the world is getting back on its feet post corona. Since we were confined in our houses for close to two years and the world began to heal itself with better quotients on environmental factors, it's our utmost responsibility to respect our self-healing environment.</p>
          <br>
          <p class="text-justify font-weight-normal">I realised it's my turn to give back to society, and the best place to start is the institution that gave us all the proper education, training, and confidence to face the world. I remember entering the college for the first time after graduation this year for an alumni meet. The building got extended, and the sections have increased, but the zeal that students had today and in our times still looked the same. Most of the students have attended their lectures from home till 2022. For working professionals, this has been no different. Though there were perks worth mentioning like reduced traffic and bad roads, zero travel time to offices or college, more family time, being there for our loved ones, and many more; we also missed office chai time, lunch break debates, teamwork activities, better coordination due to same work location, and most importantly ergonomically well-placed work environment.</p>
          <p class="text-justify font-weight-normal">In 2022, the transition from web conferences to meeting rooms, from voices to in-person meet-ups, and mainly work from home which had become our lifestyle to office hours, needs a re-training of the mind, especially from taking calls in pajamas to office attire. The year 2022 is a transition year for us all, which includes our college students too. From a web class to classrooms and from virtual teaching to in-person interaction with teachers is a different experience. I feel the batch that has experienced both the flavours is lucky, as they will be able to acclimatize a lot quicker to unforeseen situations. As an alumnus and a part of SFITAA, I wish the students good luck with this transition journey. Also, we assure the assistance required by each one of them to ace personally and professionally in this journey.</p>
